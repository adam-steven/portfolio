As the number of states in a finite state machine increase, it becomes more challenging to manage. Therefore, this project sought to test how the weighted version, known for being easier to implement, would compare. A Hotline Miami style game created using Unity and C#. The two AI methods were integrated into the enemy AI and tested on participants to see if they could identify any differences between the two state machines. The results indicated that although users couldn't discern differences between the enemies, the weighted version proved to be more manageable and thus the preferable development option.",
        "contribution": "I developed the Hotline Miami-style game in Unity using C#, including all of the assets, player control, and random level generation.
